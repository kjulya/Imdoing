No roots

I like digging holes and hiding things inside them
When I’ll grow old I hope I won’t forget to find them
‘Cause I’ve got memories
And travel like gypsies in the night

I built a home and wait for someone to tear it down
Then pack it up in boxes, head for the next town running
‘Cause I’ve got memories
And no more
